# STM32
Embedded Project Code

1 Basically completed the testing of the two symptoms. But for testing purposes, an analog signal test was used, as the hand crank may not crank the corresponding frequency (this may need to be improved subsequently)
2 Use with STMcubeMX can initialize a lot of modules so had to use c language, the difference is not very big.
3 .c files other than the main.c file are used to initialize the corresponding modules.
